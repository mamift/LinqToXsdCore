# XObjectsCode
This project contains the code generation logic that enables most of the functionality of the **LinqToXsd**-tool. While a separate project, it is tightly linked to **XObjectsCore** as the generated code needs to call into the **XObjectsCore**  API surface. It used to be a part of **XObjectsCore** but was split out so as to keep the **XObjectsCore** library as small as possible as it is a mandatory dependency for client libraries.

It is meant to be consumed by the **LinqToXsd** global tool and not meant to be used by users of the **LinqToXsd** tool or added to client libraries. You probably want to add **[XObjectsCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/XObjectsCore)** to your library.
