# LinqToXsdCore Release Notes

## Version 3.3.2
Nuget packages:
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/LinqToXsdCore/3.3.2
	* This update only applies to the LinqToXsd global `dotnet` tool; it fixes a bug whereby a non-functional class constructor was being generated for classes for XSD elements, whose schema types are simple types, and said simple types are defined as enum restrictions on string types (like `NMToken` or `xs:string`). The functional constructor now converts from a given string value to the inner enum type by parsing the string value and convert it to it's proper inner enum type (stored in the TypedValue property).

## Version 3.3.1
Nuget packages:
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/LinqToXsdCore/3.3.1
	* This update only applies to the LinqToXsd global `dotnet` tool; it re-enables .NET Core 3.1 as a runtime target, and also adds .NET 5, alongside .NET 6 that was added in 3.3.0.
	* PDB debug information is now embedded inside the shipping assemblies.

## Version 3.3.0

Nuget packages:
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/LinqToXsdCore/3.3.0
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/XObjectsCore/3.3.0
	* The LinqToXsd global tool now targets .NET 6 (note that the supporting library [XObjectsCore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/XObjectsCore/3.3.0) and all code generated by the LinqToXsd tool still targets .NET Standard 2.)
	* This new release fixes bugs with the content model and enum code generation. It incorporates contributions from [rvuistin](https://github.com/rvuistin) in [PR36](https://github.com/mamift/LinqToXsdCore/pull/36) (many thanks!).

## LinqToXsdCore 3.2.1 and XObjectsCodeGen 3.2.1 (no changes to XObjectsCore)
Nuget packages:
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/LinqToXsdCore/3.2.1
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/XObjectsCodeGen/3.2.1
	* Disabled checking for duplicate enum type declaration when creating a nested enum type for a property on a generated class (partially resolves [GitHub Issue 31](https://github.com/mamift/LinqToXsdCore/issues/31)).

## LinqToXsdCore 3.2.0, XObjectsCore 3.2.0 and XObjectsCodeGen 3.2.0
Nuget packages:
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/LinqToXsdCore/3.2.0
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/XObjectsCore/3.2.0
	* XObjectsCore has now had all the code generation facilities split into a separate library: XObjectsCodeGen. This change now means that generated code no longer needs to depend on System.CodeDom when it is used in shipping apps or libraries.
	* Fixes an error that occurs when attempting to pass null to a property that had validation logic in the property setter (see [GitHub PR28](https://github.com/mamift/LinqToXsdCore/pull/28)).
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/XObjectsCodeGen/3.2.0
	* The number of `XName` instantiations in generated code is now greatly reduced (see [GitHub PR23](https://github.com/mamift/LinqToXsdCore/pull/23)).
	* Now includes an option for null-annotating generated code (see [GitHub PR29](https://github.com/mamift/LinqToXsdCore/pull/29)).	
	* Enums in generated code are now properly generated as CLR value types (see [GitHub 21](https://github.com/mamift/LinqToXsdCore/pull/21)).
	* Updated to fix ambiguous types where an element is a base type and a derrived type is used (see [GitHub 16](https://github.com/mamift/LinqToXsdCore/pull/16)).

## LinqToXsdCore 3.1.0 and XObjectsCore 3.1.0
Nuget packages:
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/LinqToXsdCore/3.1.0
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/XObjectsCore/3.1.0
	* Fixed a enum type generation bug that occurs when referencing locally defined enum types.
	* Also fixed another one enum generation bug for multiple inline enum types defined with the same name; the XSD spec allows for multiple inline enum types to share the same name so long as they're not defined in the same complex type or element, and are not global types.
	* Fixed an issue with ambiguous types where an element is a base type and a derrived type is used.

## LinqToXsdCore 3.0.1 and XObjectsCore 3.0.1
Nuget packages:
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/LinqToXsdCore/3.0.1
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/XObjectsCore/3.0.1
	* Fixed [Github Issue #10](https://github.com/mamift/LinqToXsdCore/issues/10)
	* Imported code changesets for v2.0.2 from the legacy [LinqToXsd project](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=linqtoxsd), which generates the proper type definitions for union types.
	* Switched to a tripartite versioning scheme.
	* The global tool LinqToXsd now targets .NET Core 3.1 in addition to .NET Core 2.1. This allows users using either version of .NET Core to still use the global tool to generate code.

## LinqToXsdCore 3.0.0.12 and XObjectsCore 3.0.0.11
Nuget packages:
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/LinqToXsdCore/3.0.0.12
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/XObjectsCore/3.0.0.11
	* When a group of XSD files or a folder of them all import or include each other, LinqToXsd cannot decide which one to use as the entry point for code generation, so now the CLI throws an exception when that condition is met while trying to resolve which XSD file to use.
	* Reverts "Avoid type name conflicts in generated code" from previous release, as it broke the code generation of the `BuildWrapperDictionary()` method generated inside the `LinqToXsdTypeManager`; it adds `typeof(void)` expressions, which breaks untyped `XElement` type conversion. Previous (and correct) behavior was to add `typeof(T)` expressions where T was the generated complex or global element type.
	* Fixes an issue whereby setting a string value to an attribute whose type was `AnyAtomicType` resulted in an error.
	* Fixes an issue when using the static Parse() or Load() methods on an internal generated type.

## LinqToXsdCore 3.0.0.11 and XObjectsCore 3.0.0.10
Nuget packages:
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/LinqToXsdCore/3.0.0.11
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/XObjectsCore/3.0.0.10
	* Avoid type name conflicts in generated code. 
	* Do not prefix an identifier with the '@' character when not needed.

## XObjectsCore 3.0.0.9
Nuget packages: 
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/XObjectsCore/3.0.0.9

Added `XTypedElementEqualityComparer` and `XTypedElementDeepEqualityComparer` classes that implement `IEqualityComparer{T}` for the `XTypedElement` class.

## LinqToXsdCore 3.0.0.10 and XObjectsCore 3.0.0.8
Nuget packages: 
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/XObjectsCore/3.0.0.8
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/LinqToXsdCore/3.0.0.10

Modified the behaviour of retrieving the value of an attribute, when the schema type is anyAtomicType (which is the default for attributes when no type is given). The value literal is now returned as a string (pre-existing behaviour would throw an exception saying that anyAtomicType is not a supported conversion to the CLR type 'string').

## XObjectsCore 3.0.0.7
Nuget packages: 
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/XObjectsCore/3.0.0.7
	* Fixed a regression bug with previous release.

## LinqToXsdCore 3.0.0.9 and XObjectsCore 3.0.0.6
Nuget packages: 
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/XObjectsCore/3.0.0.6
	* Fixed an issue when performing an explicit type conversion from XElement to its XTyped-equivalent when the XTyped-equivalent type was an internal class.
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/LinqToXsdCore/3.0.0.9
	* Generating a new config file no longers includes the Xml.Schema.Linq schema namespace mapping. Also generating a new config file will generate a default namespace mapping when the XSD does not target a namespace. 

## LinqToXsdCore 3.0.0.8
Nuget packages: 
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/LinqToXsdCore/3.0.0.8
	* Implemented saving merged output from multiple XSD files when generating a config file (using 'config -e' switch) using a folder as a source.

## XObjectsCore 3.0.0.5 and LinqToXsdCore 3.0.0.7
Nuget packages: 
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/XObjectsCore/3.0.0.5
	* Reversed a change made that removed the virtual keyword on properties on generated types. Added a test for it.
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/LinqToXsdCore/3.0.0.7
	* Dropped emitting errors to a custom handler. Was outputting red console text needlessly.

## XObjectsCore 3.0.0.4 and LinqToXsdCore 3.0.0.6
Nuget packages: 
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/XObjectsCore/3.0.0.4
* https://www.nuget.org/packages/LinqToXsdCore/3.0.0.6

Fixes a bug that caused XTypedElement.Clone() to fail when generated code had the `internal` visibility modifier. This manifested in the CLI tool, when attempting to use it to generate an example configuration file `linqtoxsd config 'file.xsd' -e`.
