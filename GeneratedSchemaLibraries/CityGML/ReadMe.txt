OGC(r) City Geography Markup Language Encoding Standard
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The CityGML standard is an OpenGIS(r) Standard which defines a
conceptual model and exchange format for the representation, storage and
exchange of virtual 3D city and landscape models.

Where are the codelists?

The codelists for the values of enumerative attributes like "class", 
"function", "usage" etc. do not belong to the normative part of the 
CityGML specification, because these typically will require different
values for different countries. The codelists provided in the 
specification document are to be considered as an example for the 
definition of appropriate codelists. Since they have been defined by 
the SIG 3D they can be found in (and used from) the following 
repository
  http://www.sig3d.de/codelists/standard/
  
The codelists have therefore been deleted from the OGC Schema
repository. A zip archive containing the codelists that were shipped 
as examples with CityGML 1.0 can however still be downloaded from
  http://schemas.opengis.net/citygml/codelists/
