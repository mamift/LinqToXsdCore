VICTER-eis Schema Version 4.0

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This schema is provided to enable local authorities to use the VICTER-eis electronic interface to submit RO referrals and retieve associated decisions.

The primary purpose of this update is to change the data pattern for the LA_CODE in anticipation of the necessity to switch to using DWP LASER ID numbers to identify new unitary authorities.

Implementation date 1 Mar 2009: to provide new authorities opportunity for testing prior to merger on 1 April 2009.


Changes:

1) Common.xsd: 
	a)	LACode element - Data pattern removed.
	This enables both formats to be used.
	b)	UKPostalAddressStructure - Now mandatory
	Local implementation to ensure that all submissions have valid postcode.
