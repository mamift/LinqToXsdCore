These are values that are descriptive in classifying a position or a position opportunity or \"offering\". They are not precise classes useful internally to drive pay, benefits, or HR compliance. Enumerated values are: DirectHire, Temporary, TemporaryToHire, ContractToHire, Contract, Internship, Externship, Apprenticeship, Seasonal, Student, and Volunteer. Consider that \"Temporary\" and \"DirectHire\" are not parallel concepts, but are still commonly used in classifying jobs within advertising.",
