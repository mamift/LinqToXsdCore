	<annotation>
		<documentation>  
		A slightly modified profile of OGC 05-016_OpenLS_core_services_1.1 that is based on GML version 3.2.1 instead of GML version 3.0, containing type and element definitions from
             geometry.xsd
             

		See http://schemas.opengeospatial.net/ols/1.1.0/
		See documentation in type definitions below for details.
		
	  Backward incompatibilities include:
	  	* gid replaced by gml:id
	  	* dimension attribute replaced by srsDimension
	  	* gml:pos replaced by gml:lowerCorner and gml:upperCorner in gml:Envelope
	  	* gml:MultiPolygon replaced by xls:MultiPolygon
	  	
	  	These changes are significant enough to warrent incrementing the minor version from 1 to 2 for change proposal to OGC.

  			2006-09-04 Changes
			
				1.  Change namespaces following conventions proposed in OGC 05-065r3 to include version and profile information, 
				      except that complete version is used instead of BNF "principle version".  
				      a) targetNamespace was http://www.opengis.net/xls; changed to http://www.opengis.net/xls/1.1.0/DHS-GMO/1.0.0
				      b) gml namespace was http://www.opengis.net/gml; changed to http://www.opengis.net/gml/3.1.1/DHS-GMO/1.0.0					  

				2.  Include complete OGC copyright notice from http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/software
		
			2006-04-14
				rename to ols4niem.xsd
				move to proposed external components directory structure
				change path to gml4niem.xsd
				
			2005-12-31 	
				rename from ADT.xsd to xls4niem.xsd
				change import from gml4xls311.xsd to gml4niem.xsd
				change include from geometry.xsd to geometry4xls.xs

			2005-12-29  
				import gml4xls311.xsd instead of gml4xls.xsd
				use xls:MultiPolygonType to replace deprecated GML 311 MultiPolygonType

			2006-01-01
			 	import gml4niem.xsd instead of gml4xls311.xsd

			2006-01-05
				add documentation
							
			2006-01-07
				Put definitions from geometry4xls.xsd and UOM.xsd in-line to conform to NIEM schema practice
				whereby there is only one schema document per namespace.
				Added appinfo elements to indicate source of type definitions.
						
			2006-01-09
			 	Add references to (empty) gml:AssociationAttributeGroup
			 			 	
			2006-01-21
			    Add RouteService, XLS definitions
